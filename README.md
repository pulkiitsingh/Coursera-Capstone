This project was done as the final project  to apply all that I learnt in the Machine Learning with Python by IBM course on Coursera.
The task was to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. The following algorithms were used to build the models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
